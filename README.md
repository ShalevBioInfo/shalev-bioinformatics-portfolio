# GitHub Portfolio — Computational Biology Projects

Curated, gradual, and private-for-now portfolio of my computational genomics work.

## Purpose
Document clean, stable, well-explained versions of analyses (no live lab data).

## Status
Private (WIP). Will be made public when first projects are ready.

## Projects (coming soon)
- cilia_clusters (demo)
- local_barcode_analysis (demo)
- heatmap_visualization (demo)

## Structure
`projects/` per project (scripts + demo results) • `notebooks/` for light exploration.

## Data & Privacy
All data here are synthetic/demo only. Original datasets remain confidential.
