# Heatmap Visualization (Demo)

Visual demonstration of plotting synthetic **NPP/LPP-like** matrices as heatmaps.

## Overview
Shows a minimal workflow to load a small synthetic matrix (mimicking NPP/LPP structure)
and render a heatmap image. **No real lab data.**

## Scripts
- scripts/make_heatmap.py — loads a tiny synthetic matrix and saves esults/example_heatmap.png.

## Input & Output
Input: synthetic CSV created in code or included as tiny demo.
Output: esults/example_heatmap.png (demo), optional demo_matrix.csv.

## Purpose
Provide a clear, reproducible example of heatmap rendering for portfolio.

 All data here are synthetic and for demonstration only. Original datasets remain confidential.
